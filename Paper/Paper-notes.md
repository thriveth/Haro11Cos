What do the papers in literature say? 
=======================================

Verhamme 2015 
--------------

* AGN not enough to reionize th Universe as they come too late and are too few
  [@Cowie2009; @Fontanot2012]. 
* LyC radiation shows spatial offset from UV continuum emission [@Clarke2002],
  or unresolved mergers
* LyC leakage stronger in LAEs than LBGs, and scales inversely with mass
  [@Ferrera2013; @Yajima2011].
* LAEs have lower mass haloes [@Ouchi2005].
* Higher FescLyC from lower-luminosity galaxies (no references?)
* Hoping that LyA profile can give hints about LyC escape
* Two scenarios: 
    1. Optically thin isotropic/homogeneous medium, 
    2. Riddled, optically thick medium
    (Me: Most likely reaslistic scenarios are a linear combination of the two - Verhamme also say so in 2.3.1, and point to @Duval2014 about residual neutral H in the ionized/dilute interclump medium).
* Production of LyA photons falls when LyC escape becomes effective.
* Haro 11 knot C has LyA/Ha $\sim$ 10, indicatiing direct escape through holes
  or an optically thin medium. 
* Mentions that @Sandberg2013 finds suggestiuons that the neutral medium is
  clumpy. Maybe also mention my own work telling that it finds low Halpha in
  knot C, and 

### Results: 

* Galaxies with low enough N_HI (< 10¹⁸ cm⁻¹) to leak LyC also have narrow LyA
  profiles due to few interactions -> small RT effects. Either double-peaked
  with small peak separation; or single peak with low peak redshift ($\sim 10$
  km s^-1^ ) wrt. systemic. However, high-velocity outflows can also lead to a
  low red peak shift due to doppler shift - however, they will sure not leave a
  noticeable blue peak.
* Galaxies with riddled, optically thick media, have a LyA profile *dominated
  by* a fraction of the intrinsic LyA profile. 


Jaskot & Oey 2013 
------------------

High [OIII]/[OII] ratio could mean high ionization degree, see also
@Verhamme2015 sect. 2.2.3, end of. 

Alexandroff 2015 
-----------------

Hayes 2007 
-----------

* Knot C emits Lya/Ha at recombination-like values [$\sim 8.7$, @Osterbrock]-
  sign of direct escape. This, @Leitet2013 interprets as a sign of possible LyC
  escape. Points to @Sandberg2013 who find neutral infalls which, they say,
  cannot explain the strong LyA escape unless there is a picket fence model at
  play.

Heckman 2011, 2015 
-------------------

Low-ionisation absorption lines can trace the covering fraction of neutral gas
opaque to LyC. This diagnostic is sensitive to resolution as well as
metallicity, however. See also @Jones2013.


Leitet 2011 
------------

Report that @Bergvall2006 find an escape fraction of 4-10%, while re-analysis
of the same observations by @Grimes2007 found it to be around 2%.
