## Abstract:

Something something something.


Introduction and Observations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

About Haro 11: Some of the same stuff as in Rivera-Thorsen et al. (in prep.)
could be mentioned, with a different emphasis. Star formation rate should be
mentioned from @Adamo2010. Population from same and from @Micheva2010. Knots
named by @Vader1993, and also mentioned by @Kunth2003. It's an LBA
[@Hoopes2007], and an LAE analog [@Hayes2007; @Leitet2011]. Knot C a strong
Ly$\alpha$ emitter [@Hayes2007], and also a LyC emleaker [@Bergvall2006;
Leitet2011]. Kinematics, it's a merger [@Ostlin1999; @Ostlin2001; @Ostlin2015]. More weight on the Lyman-$\alpha$ escape thing, and LyC. Mention Ly$\alpha$ escape and the histrory here, too? References:

Caption: Approximate coverage of the COS aperture. The aperture, which was
centered on the supercluster in knot C, has a diameter of 2.5 \arcsec

Caption: Full spectrum in restframe wavelength of Haro 11 C. Redshift adopted
from @Sandberg2013. Orange lines denote Milky Way absorption, while blue lines
denote absorption internal to the target.

Caption: **Upper panel**: Ly$\alpha$ profile of Haro 11 C, in approximate units
of the surrounding continuum level. Full line is the measured values smoothed
by a 5 px. flat kernel; surrounding shading encloses the $\pm 1 \sigma$ error
band. **Middle panel**: Black steps show the averaged, LIS line profile,
smoothed by a 5px kernel. Surrounding gray shading denotes the $\pm 1 \sigma$
confidence band.  **Lower panel**: Same as middle panel, but for the
\ion{Si}{4} transitions.
